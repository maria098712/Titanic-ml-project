# Titanic-ml-project
Titanic dataset EDA and ML classification
# 🛳 Titanic Survival Prediction – ML Project

This project was created as part of my NAVTTC AI course to practice data analysis and machine learning using Python.  
It includes a full pipeline from raw data to model evaluation using the classic Titanic dataset.
